# Blade and Sorcery official SDK

This repository is still a work in progress and should evolve over time depending of game updates and community involvement ;)

The Bas SDK is composed of 3 folders:

# BasAssetsCreator
An Unity project used to create assets bundles (compressed archive containing textures, meshes, sounds, etc...).
 
# Plugins
A visual studio project example of a plugin.

# ModFolderExample
An example of finalized mod. The folder need to be dropped in [Blade & Sorcery folder]\BladeAndSorcery_Data\StreamingAssets to be loaded by the game.
